<h3>
<a id="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions</h3>

<p>The goal setting and evaluation process is designed to be an ongoing conversation between manager and employee throughout the year. The process has three main steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Goal Setting
At the beginning of the cycle, managers and employees jointly set SMART goals using the Goal Setting form.</li>
<li>Review the employee's job description to identify their core responsibilities.</li>
<li>Review the department's Strategic Plan</li>
<li>Set 2-3 Core Responsibility goals that reflect the employee's main job functions while also aligning with the department’s Strategic Plan goals.</li>
<li>Set 1-2 Individual Development goals are related to professional or personal development. The Metro HR Individual Development Plan may be used as a tool to discuss the employee's career aspirations and define related goals</li>
<li>Once completed, submit goals to department leadership for approval.</li>
<li>Once approved, the goals should be shared in a central spot that will be visible on a day-to-day basis (like on a whiteboard in the office).</li>
<li>Ongoing Feedback and Mid Year Checkin</li>
<li>At regular intervals (at least every six months, preferably quarterly), managers and employees check in on goal progress using the Mid Year Check In form.</li>
<li>Based on progress and new information, make adjustments to goals as necessary. Update your Visual Dashboard to reflect changes and progress.</li>
<li>Overall Evaluation</li>
<li>At the end of the cycle, the manager should set up an in-person meeting for the end-of-year evaluation with the employee.</li>
<li>One week ahead of the scheduled meeting, the employee should complete the Self Evaluation and send it to their manager, along with any supporting work samples or documentation that is exemplary of their performance.</li>
<li>The manager reviews these materials and completes Sections 1-5 the Overall Evaluation.</li>
<li>Manager and employee meet to discuss progress and collaboratively complete the feedback section (Section 6) of the Overall Evaluation. This conversation is used to inform the goal setting process for the upcoming cycle.</li>
<li>Submitted completed evaluation to department leadership for approval. Provide a signed copy to Metro HR and the employee.</li>
</ol>
